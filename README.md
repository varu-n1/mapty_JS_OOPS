# mapty
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Mapty is a result of applying various web development concepts to create a user-friendly application. Users can add their cycling or running activities to the map, including details such as distance, duration, and location. This information is visually represented on the map using markers, making it easy to track and visualize their fitness activities over time.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>User-friendly interface for adding cycling and running activities.</li>
  <li>Utilizes the Leaflet library for interactive and dynamic maps.</li>
  <li>Activities are displayed on the map with custom markers.</li>
  <li>Form input validation to ensure accurate activity data.</li>
  <li>Encapsulation and inheritance are employed to create modular and maintainable code.</li>
  <li>Activity data is stored locally, allowing users to revisit their activities even after closing the browser.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Learnings</h3>
<p>Throughout the development of Mapty, various skills and concepts were learned and applied:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Project planning using user stories, flowcharts, and rough structure of classes.</li>
  <li>Working with classes to create modular and organized code.</li>
  <li>Integrating external libraries like Leaflet to enhance functionality.</li>
  <li>Reading and understanding documentation for the Leaflet library.</li>
  <li>Implementing form input validation to ensure accurate data.</li>
  <li>Utilizing encapsulation to hide implementation details and expose only necessary methods.</li>
  <li>Applying inheritance to create specialized classes with shared functionality.</li>
</ul>
